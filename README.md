# Edu_Solar_System
An Educational Solar System Project using C++ is a software application designed to simulate and visualize the solar system for educational purposes. It typically involves object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to represent celestial bodies and their movements, using mathematical models for orbital mechanics.

Key Features of the Project:-

Object-Oriented Design
Each celestial body (Sun, planets, moons) is represented as a class.
Attributes like mass, diameter, orbital radius, and speed are encapsulated in objects.

Simulation of Orbital Mechanics
Uses physics-based equations (Keplerâ€™s laws) to simulate planet orbits.
Implements time-step simulations for real-time movement.

Graphical Visualization (Optional)
Uses graphics libraries like OpenGL, SFML, or SDL for rendering planets and orbits.
Allows interactive zooming and rotation for better visualization.

User Interaction & Data Display
Displays information about each planet when selected.
Provides real-time distance calculations from the Sun.
Allows users to speed up or slow down the simulation.

Additional Features
Custom Planetary Systems: Allows users to add hypothetical exoplanets.
Collision Detection: Checks if objects overlap due to incorrect orbits.
Time Acceleration: Fast-forwards the simulation to observe long-term planetary motion.

Technologies Used
C++: Core programming language for logic and simulation.
SFML/OpenGL/SDL: Optional libraries for graphical rendering.
Mathematics & Physics: Trigonometry and orbital mechanics for motion simulation.
Applications
Used in educational institutions to teach astronomy interactively.
Helps students understand planetary motion, gravity, and celestial mechanics.
Can be expanded into game development or scientific research tools.
